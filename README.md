The Reddit user [elvaan](https://www.reddit.com/user/elvaan) requested a program that satisfies the following criteria:

>
>1. It scans the screen and searches for `X` image.
>
>2. If it finds `X`, it clicks at `Y` location.
>
>3. Else, it scrolls down and searches again for `X` image.
>
>4. If it fails again, it clicks on `Z` and starts over.
>
>5. `X`, `Y`, and `Z` can be customized.

This is my attempt at fulfilling his request.
